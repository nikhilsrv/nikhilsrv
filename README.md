### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Nikhil Srivastava

As a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology from Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology, I am deeply passionate about building impactful software solutions and user-centric web applications. With hands-on experience as a Full Stack Developer at Digirocket Technologies, Iâ€™ve developed and deployed real-world applicationsâ€”from e-commerce platforms to content management systemsâ€”leveraging technologies like React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. My technical background, combined with a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and systems, enables me to design scalable, secure, and responsive applications. I aspire to grow as a Software Developer or Full Stack Developer, contributing to innovative teams where I can continue learning, solving real-world problems, and creating seamless digital experiences that add value to users and businesses alike.
